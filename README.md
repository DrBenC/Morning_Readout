This is a simple script which will summarise the weather in York and then read out a selection of headlines. Outputs to current speaker.

Requires pyttsx3, pygooglenews, requests and json. runs windowless - I keep it on my desktop and run it every morning.

If you're planning on using this often, please use your own OpenWeather API key - I doubt I'll hit the limit on requests but its free for you to set up yourself.
